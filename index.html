                    <h4>Eating Disorders a New Front in Insurance Fight</h4>
                    <h6>By ANDREW POLLACK</h6>
                    <h6>Published: October 13, 2011</h6>
                    <p>People with eating disorders like anorexia have opened up a new battleground in the insurance wars, testing the boundaries of laws mandating equivalent coverage for mental illnesses.</p>
                    <p>Through claims and court cases, those with severe cases of anorexia or bulimia are fighting insurers to pay for stays in residential treatment centers, arguing that the centers offer around-the-clock monitoring so that patients
                      do not forgo eating or purge their meals.</p>
                    <p>But in the last few years, some insurance companies have re-emphasized that they do not cover residential treatment for eating disorders or other mental or emotional conditions. The insurers consider residential treatments not
                      only costly — sometimes reaching more than $1,000 a day — but unproven and more akin to education than to medicine. Even some doctors who treat eating disorders concede there are few studies proving that residential care is
                      effective, although they believe it has value.</p>
